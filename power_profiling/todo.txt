- RF24 scanning
- RF24 receiving
- DMXNow scanning, with RF24 shield
- DMXNow receiving, low traffic (1-2/sec), with RF24 shield
- DMXNow scanning, without RF24 shield
- DMXNow receiving, low traffic (1-2/sec), without RF24 shield
- DMXNow receiving, high traffic (40/sec), without RF24 shield
- sACN scanning, without RF24 shield
- sACN receiving, low traffic (1-2/sec), without RF24 shield
- sACN receiving, high traffic (40/sec), without RF24 shield

Notes:
- RF24 shield presence makes no significant difference if shield not used
- sACN/DMXNow low traffic vs high traffic makes no significant difference

- Visually, sACN looks very rough and feels sluggish. Output delayed up to 1-2 seconds.
